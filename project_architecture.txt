The proposed architecture integrates FastAPI for building a responsive web service with SciPy's extensive mathematical capabilities. It includes user interaction through a frontend, a backend API for processing requests, core modules for different mathematical operations, a database for persistent storage, and optional task management for heavy workloads. The systematic approach ensures not only performance but also maintainability and scalability to accommodate future enhancements.
